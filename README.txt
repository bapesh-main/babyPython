# babyPython
Many firsts here. First time I've used either Git or Python for an actual project, but thankfully the tasks were not hard. Used only common sys, math and string operations.

Having said that, I'm unsure if my solution for stdin input is what you're expecting.

And the cipher problem would have been a lot more tough if "m" or "n" > 702. Thanks, I guess!
